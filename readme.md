### H2O Py4Java example

Steps to run in VS Code (but something similar will apply in a different app)

1. Make sure the `libs` folder are included as a reference library. in VS Code, install the Java extension and look for `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` tab in the lower left corner to add the folder. `h2o-genmodel.jar` and `py4j0.10.9.jar` should appear under the `Referenced Libraries`tab
2. Start the Java Gateway Server by running `main` from `EntryPoint.java`. In VS Code, you'll see a `Run` button above the `main` function.
3. Now you can run `main.py`
